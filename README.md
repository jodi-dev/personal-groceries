SEG3125 Lab 2.

## Motivation

I will be using Bootstrap Studio to design a basic layout. Bootstrap 4 components will be used to expediate the frontend implementation. I will also be using JavaScript blended with JQuery elements because I got too ambitious in my concepts and started planning for complicated functionalities, hence it would take too long at my level to be writing only JavaScript.

Alterations in design compared to the Prof's template to improve application functionality:

1. Allergies selectable by checkboxes as opposed to single select as an individual may have multiple allergies; this is an improvement in design as the functionality of the application is better suited to user needs
1. Product selection in cards and laid out on screen at all times as opposed to being in a tab, tabs however are moved to the right hand side as a component on the page to allow the users to look at available products and modify their selection at all times
