# personal-groceries
SEG3125 Lab 2.

## Criteria

- Tailor JS website to personas
- The name of the grocery store (this is not present in the code provided)
- At least 10 possible products in the product list (I have provided 3) described in terms of features appropriate to the userâ€™s needs (containing lactose, containing nuts).
- Navigation between three zones (personal data, products, cart)
- A personal data entry area
    - A user must be able to filter between lactose-intolerant and/or nut allergies
    - Each user can indicate a preference for organic products or not. (This is not taken into account in the code provided, so it is to be added in the options, and also to add a characteristic for this purpose in the list of products).
- An area for choosing items
    - Items should have their price indicated. (to add to the code provided)
    - Items should be in price order. (to add to the code provided)
- An area giving the basket view
    - the contents of the basket and its total
- Your signature (Website designed by ...) at the bottom of the page.
- The use of external CSS (separate file) to define styles for titles, divisions, and your signature at the bottom of the site. Explore font, color, alignment, etc. changes to make the site look a little nicer. Although, for this particular lab, your evaluation will be on functionality, so don't waste too much time here if you're just starting out in JavaScript.
- The use of JavaScript (separate files) to contain the script associated with the site.


## Inspirations

I will be using Bootstrap Studio to design a basic layout. Bootstrap 4 components will be used to expediate the frontend implementation.
